# Ensemble scraper

> Create all functional elements datasets you ever wanted.

Ensemble scraper is command-line tool for accessing data from Ensemble and creating classification datasets from them. 

[Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data.

## Workflow

 - downloading loci of functional elements for organisms of interest
 - converting data to specified format
 - preprocessing to remove low quality data
 - generating negative class for classification dataset
